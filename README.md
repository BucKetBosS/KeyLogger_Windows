# KeyLogger
This is my first project.
This is a basic keylogger written completely in C++, making use of the  'GetAsyncKeyState' API
This is written in Microsoft Visual Studio Ultimate 2013

#Features:

~~Stealth~~ (done)

Support for Keys that do not have  printable ASCII character equivalent (eg. backspace, tab, etc.)

Differentiate between uppercase and lowercase letters

and many more

An executable of the code is present in the  /debug directory
The Source is present in the /KeyLogger directory
The output text file will be saved in same directory as that of the executable

Inorder to build the execctable yourself
In Microsoft Visual Studio Ultimate 2013 goto Build->Build Solution (or Press F7) 
In Dev-c++ just compile the code and you will get the executable in the same directory as that of the soruce
